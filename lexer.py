What does actually the parser do ?
    -Parser takes the tokens in the order that they where given
    -Check if this pattern actually means anything
    -example:
    -FUNC VARIABLE_NAME() -> a+b;
    -means if founc -> after the FUNC return this operation
    -The Parser has to figure out if the language matches our grammar
